# BookingSystem

user contacts the chatbot to request for a booking. User may already know which
movie she wants to watch and/or what time. After the choosing the movie, user needs to specify the preferred
timeslot; chatbot needs to check whether the timeslot (and requested number of seats) is available or not; if
not, then chatbot can provide list of available timeslots. User selects the available timeslot (or choose another
time/day) and the booking is made.
